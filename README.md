# Quantum Monte Carlo for Power Systems

This project focuses on comparing the performance of different QAE algorithms: IterativeAmplitudeEstimation,
MaximumLikelihoodAmplitudeEstimation and
FasterAmplitudeEstimation. These functions are integrated in Qiskit. In the code the mean, Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are estimated. This is done for different probability distributions. Furthermore, these algorithms are compared with classical Monte Carlo simulation. 

The version of qiskit that is used is 0.45.0
This code is part of https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17299
